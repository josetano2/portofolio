      EasyWork is an AI-powered application designed to reduce unemployment and address the wage gap in Indonesia. In recent years, unemployment has become a growing issue, 
      exacerbated by a lack of financial literacy, formal education, and accessible skill development resources. This challenge affects not only individuals with limited 
      skills but also those who are qualified yet struggle to find employment. Recognizing this, our team was inspired to create a platform that connects people with job 
      opportunities, helping them secure meaningful employment.~

      EasyWork is designed to be user-friendly. Users can input their educational background, work experience, and other relevant details, and the app determines their suitability 
      for various job opportunities. Our web application leverages Large Language Models, vector databases, and Pinecone AI to automate the job search process, delivering personalized 
      job matches efficiently. The frontend is built using Next.js and Tailwind. EasyWork is created over the course of 36 hours for the Garudahacks Hackathon, created
      by a group of 4 people which are Christopher Alden, Darryl Christopher, and Theo Justin.
